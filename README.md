# Taichi for Infernux

[中文](README.zh-CN.md) · [Infernux engine](https://github.com/ChenlizheMe/Infernux) · [Upstream Taichi](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi)

This is the Taichi-derived GPU compiler dependency for **Infernux**, an
open-source game engine with a C++ runtime and Python gameplay code.
It is being integrated into the engine wheel, **not distributed as a project
plugin**. Game developers should not install a separate Taichi package.

## Direction

The current scope is JIT-only: translate engine numerical kernel code into
Vulkan SPIR-V and binding metadata. Infernux owns buffers, devices, allocation,
submission, synchronization and resource lifetime. This compiler must not own
`taichi.field`, SNode storage or a second Vulkan execution runtime.

CPU compilation remains an independent capability using Numba/llvmlite.
The engine and applicable Player builds will carry both CPU and GPU JIT tools.
AOT export and its standalone runtime are deferred.

## Status

Compiler-only conversion and release integration are **in progress**. The engine
build stages a private Python frontend and native SPIR-V compiler directly into
its wheel tree. Windows integration tests compile kernels without a GPU device
and execute their output through Infernux's Vulkan backend.

The active Python frontend no longer provides field/SNode storage owners,
device-array constructors or a kernel launch runtime. Its imports stay inside
`infernux._compiler.taichi`; it does not claim the public `taichi` namespace.
Numeric Matrix/Vector expressions and the IR needed for code generation remain.
Kernel compilation consumes engine buffer type descriptions directly, without
allocating placeholder NumPy arrays. Each entry point creates one forward kernel;
automatic gradient kernels and class-method probing have been removed.
Engine-declared helper functions are lowered inline. The separate Taichi
function-specialization/call API and its Python/Program caches have been removed;
shared optimizer IR remains internal to the compiler.
Compiler kernels own their native IR and retain their context only while needed;
neither Python nor Program keeps a process-wide list of completed kernels.
Infernux retains the exported SPIR-V artifact, not the lowering objects or
generated-source entries used to produce it.
The native context calls the SPIR-V compiler directly, without a selectable
Program backend or a process-wide singleton lifetime. Its output is just code
and metadata: the old TIC serializer, payload hashing and execution handles are
removed. Artifact storage remains the engine's responsibility. This does not
make the shared Python frontend or type factory concurrently callable.
Each native context starts with its own Vulkan compiler options. There is no
mutable global default configuration or CPU-to-GPU initialization switch;
options for removed execution backends are no longer exported.
The native binding is `_infernux_gpu_compiler`, a private engine module, not
the upstream `taichi_python` extension. Unused SNode operations, texture
constructors, mesh-field lowering and external-function-call bindings are
removed from its frontend surface; it no longer sets an upstream runtime
library directory. Shared optimizer IR is a separate, ongoing pruning task.
Compiler headers use texture-format and capability values without including a
device API. The legacy allocation/transfer/command implementation and its build
target have been removed; only Infernux performs those operations.
The standalone C-API, AOT module builders/loaders, CPU/LLVM/CUDA/AMDGPU/DirectX
code generators and execution runtimes, and upstream device backends have been
removed from source. Their legacy host/device containers are removed as well.
This includes Python AOT/graph/module tools, field-tree builders, autodiff
authoring entry points and the standalone Taichi command-line interface.
The SPIR-V compiler retains shared IR and capability/format descriptions, not a
second GPU device. Shared IR, unused UI/tools and historical tests still need
further pruning; the complete cross-platform wheel/Player matrix is not yet
validated.

The engine integration uses `inx.buffer`, `set_data/get_data`, lowercase
`inx.vector3`, CPU `@inx.jit.compile`, and GPU `@inx.compute.kernel` with
`inx.compute.launch`. Those APIs belong to Infernux, not to this dependency;
there is no standalone Taichi authoring API to install from this repository.

## Platform contract

Taichi compilation is a host/editor capability, while the generated compute
artifact is a Player capability. Windows and Linux desktop builds may carry
the Infernux CPU/GPU JIT tools and compile Vulkan SPIR-V kernels. Android
Players use Vulkan/AOT compute: kernels are compiled during Cook on a desktop
host, and the device does not carry or execute Numba, llvmlite, or the Taichi
compiler. Web Players use ordinary no-JIT Python and WebGPU; they do not ship
a Python-to-WebGPU kernel compiler. CPU-JIT source is lowered to ordinary
Python during Cook, while direct GPU-kernel declarations are rejected during
the Web build. None of these targets install a separate Taichi package or
project plugin.

## Build integration

Build through CMake and the engine's `infernux_gpu_jit_compiler` target. There is
no standalone `setup.py`/Taichi wheel release entry point. Integration tests use
`INFERNUX_BUILD_TESTS`; the upstream runtime test target is no longer supported.

Engine contributors use the Infernux `infernux` conda environment. This
dependency belongs at `external/taichi_for_infernux`, outside `external/plugins`.
The `infernux-jit` CMake preset disables AOT C-API targets and unsupported
backends. Native output goes directly to
`build/infernux-jit/wheel/Infernux/_compiler/taichi/_vendor/taichi/_lib/core`; the engine can set
`INFERNUX_COMPILER_OUTPUT_DIR` to its wheel staging location.

The `infernux_compiler` install component stages the native binding, the private
Python frontend, and LICENSE/NOTICE. The engine's `infernux_gpu_jit_compiler`
target builds and installs that payload without manual copying. Final
cross-platform dependency collection and dual-JIT Player packaging still need work.
No `.inxpkg` target or independent Taichi wheel release is provided. Historical
upstream build scripts are not the Infernux release entry point.

CI checks the build policy on Windows/Linux, builds a small native fixture and
installs the private frontend with LICENSE/NOTICE. This tests the wheel layout,
not full compiler correctness. Compiler builds, integration and performance
remain separate acceptance requirements.

The engine's `infernux.compute_compiler_only` CTest compiles from the installed
payload without loading the engine or creating a GPU device. Device execution is
covered separately by the engine's Vulkan integration tests.
